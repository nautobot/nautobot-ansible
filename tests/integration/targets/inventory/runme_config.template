# runme_config is source'd by runme.sh to set environment variables used to modify the test against different versions of Nautobot.
# entrypoint.sh generates it from runme_config.template (this file)
# There is no other way to pass environment variables to a runme.sh integration test.
# (integration_config.yml files are only helpful to ansible yaml-based tests)
